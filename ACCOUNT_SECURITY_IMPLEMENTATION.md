# Account Security Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Account Security Enhancements, including Account Lockout Protection and Password Policy & Validation features.

## Features Implemented

### 3.1 Account Lockout Protection

#### What it does:
- Prevents brute force attacks by temporarily locking accounts after repeated failed login attempts
- Automatically unlocks accounts after a specified time period
- Tracks login attempts and lock status in the database

#### Implementation Details:

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Added `loginAttempts` field (default: 0) to track failed login attempts
- Added `lockUntil` field (nullable DateTime) to store when the account lock expires
- Added `lastLoginAt` field (nullable DateTime) to track successful logins

**Configuration (via Environment Variables):**
- `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum failed attempts before locking (default: 5)
- `ACCOUNT_LOCK_TIME` - Lock duration in milliseconds (default: 900000 = 15 minutes)

**New Error Codes:**
- `ERROR_ACCOUNT_LOCKED` (429) - Account is temporarily locked
- `ERROR_MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (429) - Maximum attempts exceeded

#### How it works:
1. On login attempt, check if account is currently locked
2. If password is incorrect:
   - Increment `loginAttempts` counter
   - If attempts >= max attempts, set `lockUntil` timestamp and lock account
3. If login is successful:
   - Reset `loginAttempts` to 0
   - Clear `lockUntil` field
   - Update `lastLoginAt` timestamp
4. Locked accounts automatically unlock when current time > `lockUntil`

### 3.2 Password Policy & Validation

#### What it does:
- Enforces strong password requirements for new registrations and password changes
- Prevents users from reusing their current password when updating
- Provides clear error messages for password validation failures

#### Implementation Details:

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters (configurable via `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (@$!%*?&)

**Configuration (via Environment Variables):**
- `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH` - Minimum password length (default: 8)
- `PASSWORD_HISTORY_CHECK` - Enable/disable password reuse check (default: false)

**New Error Codes:**
- `ERROR_PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK` (400) - Password doesn't meet requirements
- `ERROR_PASSWORD_RECENTLY_USED` (400) - Password was recently used

#### How it works:
1. Password validation occurs at the schema level using Zod validation
2. During password updates, system checks if new password matches current password
3. Clear error messages guide users to create compliant passwords

## Files Modified

### Core Model Changes:
- `src/modules/user/model/index.ts` - Updated user schema with new fields and password validation
- `src/modules/user/model/error.ts` - Added new error constants

### Service Logic:
- `src/modules/user/service/index.ts` - Implemented lockout logic and password validation

### Database Schema:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added new fields to Users table
- Database migration created: `20250830161009_initial_setup_with_account_security`

### Configuration:
- `src/shared/components/config.ts` - Added security configuration section

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for customization:

```env
# Account Security Settings
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5
ACCOUNT_LOCK_TIME=900000
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
PASSWORD_HISTORY_CHECK=false
```

## Usage Examples

### Failed Login Attempts:
```
1st failed attempt: Increment counter
2nd failed attempt: Increment counter  
3rd failed attempt: Increment counter
4th failed attempt: Increment counter
5th failed attempt: Account locked for 15 minutes
```

### Password Examples:
```
❌ "password" - No uppercase, numbers, or special chars
❌ "Password" - No numbers or special chars  
❌ "Password123" - No special chars
✅ "Password123!" - Meets all requirements
✅ "MyStr0ng@Pass" - Meets all requirements
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout prevents automated password guessing
2. **Strong Passwords**: Enforced complexity reduces successful password attacks
3. **Password Reuse Prevention**: Users can't reuse current passwords
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Accounts unlock automatically after lock period
5. **Audit Trail**: Last login tracking for security monitoring

## Future Enhancements

These features provide a solid foundation for additional security features like:
- Password history (store multiple previous passwords)
- Progressive lockout times (longer locks for repeated failures)
- Account unlock via email verification
- Password strength meters in UI
- Security event logging and notifications

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive validation and error handling. Password validation can be tested using the provided `test-account-security.js` script.

To test the lockout feature:
1. Make 5 failed login attempts with the same username
2. Verify account gets locked with appropriate error message
3. Wait 15 minutes (or change lock time for testing)
4. Verify account unlocks automatically
